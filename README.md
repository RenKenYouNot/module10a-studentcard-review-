# Module 10A â€“ StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This is a React code review assignment. I reviewed the `StudentCard` component and added comments to 
explain the logic behind props, state, and interactivity. The review focused on identifying how data is passed into the component (props), how internal data is managed (state), and how user interactions trigger changes in the UI.

## What I Learned
- How to use and identify props and state: Gained practical experience in recognizing and understanding the roles of props (immutable, external data) and state (mutable, internal data) within a React component.
- How toggle functionality works with useState: Implemented and documented the use of the `useState` hook to create a toggle mechanism, observing how state updates lead to component re-renders and conditional rendering.
- How to better document and explain React components: Enhanced skills in adding clear and professional inline comments to improve readability for collaborative coding.

I don't know why, but everytime I've tried to run the local host, it just shows the default vite page.
